I am a Research Scientist at Spotify working on Causal ML. My Ph.D. from University of Tartu focused on Causal Reinforcement Learning. I studied how reinforcement learning agents can understand the world in terms of cause and effect. Building agents that see the world from a causal lens can enable principled drug discovery, informed interventions on gene regulatory networks, and better decision-making in general.
